# WebGLEndlessCarGame

## Overview

WebGLEndlessCarGame is a simple endless car game where the player controls a car to collect coins endlessly. The game was created as part of a friendly challenge to build a complete game within one hour.

## Challenge

I was challenged by a friend to build a game from scratch within just one hour. I accepted the challenge and decided to create an endless runner-style car game, focusing on simplicity and core gameplay mechanics. The main objective is to drive the car and collect as many coins as possible without any end.

## Development Process

- **Game Development:**  
  I completed the core gameplay, including car movement and coin collection, within the first hour. The game features basic controls and endless coin spawning to keep the gameplay continuous and engaging.

- **Polishing and Publishing:**  
  After finishing the game, I spent an additional hour to polish the user interface, prepare the WebGL build, and set up the project for deployment. I then published the game using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online for anyone to play.

## Features

- Endless gameplay: The car can collect coins infinitely.
- Simple controls and mechanics.
- Quick and lightweight WebGL build for easy web deployment.

## How to Play

1. Open the [index.html](index.html) file in a web browser, or visit the GitHub Pages link if available.
2. Use the on-screen controls or keyboard (if implemented) to move the car.
3. Collect as many coins as possible!

## Build & Deployment

- Built with Unity and exported as a WebGL project.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow ([.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml](.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml)).
